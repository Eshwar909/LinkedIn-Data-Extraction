Now, there’s a new version of the same gimmick — fake vendor empanelment posts. You’ve probably seen it: someone posts, “We’re empanelling new vendors — drop your details below!” But most of these never go anywhere — no calls, no emails, no real empanelment. It’s just a quick way to gain followers and appear “big” in the market. Recent reports reveal that nearly 4 in 10 companies admit to posting speculative or misleading job or business opportunities just to drive engagement. The same thing is now happening with vendor empanelments — cheap marketing disguised as opportunity. So, the next time you see one of these posts, pause and verify. Real empanelments usually come from official company pages or verified business emails, not from someone chasing likes. hashtag #LinkedInTips hashtag #DigitalEthics hashtag #VendorEmpanelment hashtag #MarketingTrends hashtag #FakePosts hashtag #SocialMediaAwareness hashtag #BrandTrust hashtag #BusinessEthics hashtag #LinkedInCommunity hashtag #NetworkingTips"

Now, there’s a new version of it — fake vendor empanelment posts. You’ll often see junior staff or new agency owners posting things like, “We’re empanelling new vendors, drop your details below!” But most of these never go anywhere — no calls, no emails, no actual empanelment. It’s just a quick way to gain followers and look “big” in the market. Recent reports show that nearly 4 in 10 companies admit to posting speculative or misleading job or business opportunities just to increase engagement. The same is now happening with vendor empanelments — cheap marketing disguised as opportunity. So, the next time you see one of these posts, pause and verify. Real empanelments usually come from official company pages or emails, not from someone chasing likes."

Having spent several years in recruitment, I’ve noticed a recurring trend — companies announcing, “We’re looking to empanel recruitment partners.” Naturally, agencies step forward with enthusiasm. We share our credentials, success stories, and capabilities — often following up with genuine intent to collaborate. And yet, too often, what follows is silence. ❌ No acknowledgment ❌ No update ❌ No closure It makes you wonder — if there’s no real intent to engage, why call it empanelment? True empanelment should go beyond collecting vendor profiles. It should reflect a genuine commitment to partnership — built on trust, clarity, and mutual accountability. Now that I’m walking the entrepreneurial path, one thing stands out more than ever: Partnerships thrive only when both sides operate with integrity, responsiveness, and respect. A meaningful vendor partnership is built on: ✅ Collaboration, not competition ✅ Transparency, not token communication ✅ Mutual growth, not one-sided gain If you’re truly looking for partners — be present, be responsive, and build relationships that matter. Because behind every agency deck and follow-up email is a team investing real effort to help you succeed.

,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ujudebug/posts,"A vendor panel system is becoming essential for businesses that work with multiple sellers, suppliers, or partners. It creates a centralized space where vendors can manage products, update stock, track orders, and handle their operations independently. With a vendor panel system, businesses gain transparency and smoother coordination. Vendors can upload inventory, view sales performance, manage pricing, and respond to customer orders in real time. This reduces manual communication and ensures faster decision making. For marketplaces and ecommerce platforms, a vendor panel system strengthens the entire supply chain by improving accuracy, reducing errors, and giving every vendor full visibility into their workflow. It supports scalability and helps businesses grow with a structured multi vendor ecosystem. hashtag #VendorPanelSystem hashtag #MultiVendorPlatform hashtag #SupplierManagement hashtag #EcommerceSolutions hashtag #MarketplaceTechnology hashtag #VendorManagement hashtag #DigitalCommerce hashtag #BusinessAutomation"

It is about building trust, fostering collaboration, and creating long-term strategic partnerships that support sustainable growth. When organizations treat their vendors as value-adding partners, the results speak for themselves: 1. Higher quality of products and services 2. Greater reliability in supply chains 3. Faster innovation and adaptability 4. Improved operational efficiency 5. Stronger resilience during market disruptions The success of your business is deeply tied to the strength of the relationships you build with your vendors.

But here’s the reality 👇 Demand doesn’t stay constant across platforms. 🔹 Another marketplace may suddenly see higher traction 🔹 Competitors might spend big on retail media 🔹 Search trends can rapidly shift category demand When that happens, the marketplace you “always bet on” may no longer be the growth driver. And by the time we realize it — 📉 Inventory is stuck 📉 Traffic is lost 📉 Sales opportunity is gone Smarter Inventory Planning Strategy Before locking inventory allocation: 1️⃣ Talk to your Category/Account Manager — Ask for demand forecasts and traffic trends 2️⃣ Understand your conversion performance — Which marketplace gives better buy intent on your assortment? 3️⃣ Align with competitor promotions — Where is your category heating up? 4️⃣ Stay flexible with replenishment — Keep buffer inventory ready for the platform gaining traction 🚀 Winners don’t assume demand… they go where demand is growing. Inventory is not “just a supply task.” It’s a strategic lever for winning peak weeks. hashtag #Ecommerce hashtag #MarketplaceGrowth"

It sounds like a paradox, but we’ve all been there. You hire an IT support partner to offload work, but you end up spending more time managing their mistakes and chasing tickets than if you had done it yourself. Over the past few years, I’ve managed several IT support vendor relationships. While some have been true partners, one experience taught me a valuable lesson. Every request became a project, and every solution created a new problem. I realized I was spending my budget and my time to do their job. If you are looking for new partners, here is my golden rule: Nail down the Statement of Work (SOW). Don't settle for boilerplate contracts. Define the scope, the escalation paths, and the penalties for non-compliance immediately. And most importantly—if the partnership isn't working, have the courage to switch.

,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecs-janitorial/posts,"Vendor Alignment Over Vendor Replacement In building operations, it’s easy to think the solution to every frustration is to replace the vendor. But most of the time, the issue isn’t the vendor — it’s the alignment. Because here’s the truth: Firing a vendor doesn’t automatically fix communication, expectations, or accountability. Sometimes it just resets the clock… and the same problems show up again with a new logo on the invoice. The most effective facility leaders don’t rush to replace — they start by aligning: 1. Clear expectations 2. Transparent reporting 3. Defined standards 4. Consistent communication 5. Shared goals When both sides understand the standard, the rhythm, and the priorities, performance rises — often faster than changing vendors. Leadership Reminder: You don’t always need a new partner. You need a partner who’s aligned with what matters most. At ECS Janitorial, we believe great results come from clarity, communication, and accountability — not churn. hashtag #FacilityManagement hashtag #OperationsLeadership hashtag #VendorManagement hashtag #BuildingExcellence hashtag #ECSJanitorial"

A few years ago, one of our largest renovation projects was at risk of going over budget by several million dollars. Instead of defaulting to “business as usual,” we leaned on a vendor relationship built on trust, transparency, and aligned incentives. The result? ✔️ Millions saved without compromising quality ✔️ A faster project timeline than forecasted ✔️ A stronger partnership that has continued to deliver ROI The takeaway is simple: vendor partnerships are not transactions. When treated as strategic collaborations—with open communication, accountability, and shared goals—they can unlock value that no spreadsheet forecast can capture.

Data Collection / Lead Generation They ask interested vendors to fill forms, share company profiles, GST, PAN, and other details. This helps them collect databases of staffing firms or recruiters without any actual intent to onboard. 2. Market Research Some companies post such ads just to gauge vendor interest, market rates, or capacity without moving forward. It becomes a free survey for them. 3.Brand Visibility & Engagement Posting ""vendor empanelment"" gets high traction on LinkedIn (likes, comments, shares). They may just be doing it for visibility, positioning, or employer branding rather than actual hiring needs. 4. Scam / Misrepresentation In rare cases, individuals posing as company reps try to scam vendors (fake onboarding, collecting fees, or misusing shared data). 5. Internal Approval Not in Place Sometimes HR/procurement teams post prematurely, without internal approvals, and later backtrack, making it appear fake. hashtag #FakeEmpanelment hashtag #VendorAlert hashtag #FakePosts"
